# Bomb_Disposal_Robot
This system makes use of robotic arm as well as robotic vehicle which helps not only to enter an area involving high risk but also to pick whatever object it wants to. The whole system is controlled via RF remote.
The system sends commands to the receiving circuit mounted on the vehicle through
push buttons. The receiving circuit involves 8051 microcontroller and a receiver which
receives commands sent by the transmitting circuit. At first the system is set to control
the movement of vehicle. In order to set the system in a mode that operates the arm.
At first the user needs to press the push buttons for moving the vehicle in whichever
direction it wants i.e. forward, backward, right or left direction.
In order to make the arm movement, the user needs to long press the forward and
backward push buttons. Thus this system makes use of camera, robotic arm and
robotic vehicle to enter a high risk involving area and also to pick, move and drop an
object as well as record the place wherever the system goes and later view it for
future reference.
